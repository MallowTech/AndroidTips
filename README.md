##Android Tip for the day 

Being impressed with the awesomeness of Rails_tips repository, We came up with the idea of tips that will allow Android community also to improve. No matter what the tip is going to be "either a small one or best one" but it will be useful for some one or the other at their level and infact higher. 

Please feel free to send us a pull request with your Android tip to be published here. Any improvements or suggestions are more than welcome!
