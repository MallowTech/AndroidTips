why android uses dvm why not jvm | 01 | Jayamurugan | https://github.com/Jaipalani | why android uses dvm why not jvm.

##DVM 
### DVM is Register based which is designed to run on low memory, uses its own byte code and runs .Dex file

##JVM
###JVM is Stack based which uses java byte code and runs .class file having JIT.

I hope the above tip will be useful.
